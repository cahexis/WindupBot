READ ME PLEASEE

(Sorry for the mess of code and organizing ^^'') <br/>

Hi! This was a one day challenge to try to create something in less than 24/7, I like to do these sometimes. <br/>
This was apart of a challenge I gave myself to make something (somewhat?) big in studio, and with a theme (robotnik's badniks from sonic!!) <br/>
There are some scraps from previous projects, so I hope you don't mind. ^^''<br/>
The files in this repository will show the scripts used for this one, if you would like to see the models and whatnot, check out the rbxl file!!  <br/>
(name).client.lua = local script  <br/>
(name).server.lua = server script <br/>
(name).lua = module script <br/>
  <br/>
If you want to use this project for anything, just give credit and link back to here.
